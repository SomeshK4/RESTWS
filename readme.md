Jersey

Supports true asynchronous (ie web sockets etc...) connections through either Atmosphere or 2.0 version.
Has support for Spring and standard injection containers (ie @Inject).
Glassfish bundles it.
It has a kick ass URI Builder
Does not necessarily require servlet container.
Sort of missing OAuth 2.0 . You'll have to use other libraries.

Resteasy

It does have asynchronous connection support
Cache support
EJB support
JBoss bundles it 
Arguably the best Spring integration (MVC handler).
More security support including early OAuth 2.0 support
